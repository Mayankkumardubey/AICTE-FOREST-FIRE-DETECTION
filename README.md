# AICTE-FOREST-FIRE-DETECTION
import the os
import the necessary libraries like matlplotlib ,numpy,tensorflow and panda.
check for gpu's and make sure whatsoever environment is used the user is compatible with it.
create the path derived from os then connect it to the dataset (make sure that you have imported the dataset from the kaggle).
list out the classes ,then visualise the data using matplotlib.
preprocess the images according to the filters and scal requiired ,make sure that you have have trsin ,test and valid generators.
map the indices
use any cnn model in this we have used sequential model,nake sure you add flatten,dense adn dropout layers also use the activation fucntion according to the requirement.
compile the model using any optimizer and loss.
Then train the model by using fit operation.
plot the graphs for accuracy and loss ,go on to save the model.
then load the image and convert it to a scalable image size, then go om to load the image.
YOUR MODEL IS SET TO BE TESTED AND USED!!!!!.
